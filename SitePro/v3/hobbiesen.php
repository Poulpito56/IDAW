    <p>Sports is another significant facet of my life. I have always been passionate about basketball, a dynamic team game that demands excellent coordination and seamless communication. When I'm not behind a screen, you'll often find me on the local basketball court, where I practice and organize friendly matches with friends. Sports, for me, are a source of energy, discipline, and camaraderieâ€”values that also reflect in my professional work.</p>
