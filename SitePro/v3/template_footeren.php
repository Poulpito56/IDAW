  Jules Caesar, having acquired magical powers, arrives on the battlefield mounted on a giant tutu-clad cactus, while his army of lunar skateboarding penguins (also equipped with magical capes) lines up behind him. He raises his polyglot umbrella, which instantly transforms into an energy shield, blocking enemy attacks.

  Meanwhile, Jules Caesar wields his giant spaghetti-shaped pencil and draws an interdimensional portal in the sky. An army of fantastic and mythological creatures emerges from it, ready to join the battle. These creatures, guided by Jules Caesar's orders transmitted through the polyglot umbrella, create total chaos among the enemies.

  As the lunar skateboarding penguins race down the battle hills, using their incredible skills to disarm and topple the enemies, the giant tutu-clad cactus spins rapidly, creating a tornado of sand and debris that blinds and disorients the opposing army.

  While chaos reigns, Jules Caesar and his army take advantage of the diversion created by these unusual objects to launch a decisive attack, thus winning the battle in an epic and completely unpredictable manner.
